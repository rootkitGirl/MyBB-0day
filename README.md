# MyBB-0day
So I was playing with MyBB and monitoring requests, and noticed a few things which led to a pretty decent bugs. These are all from personal findings testing on multiple sites.
Click [here] (https://github.com/rootkitGirl/MyBB-0day/blob/master/Write-up.md) to find the write-up of this *0day/bug/exploit* along with the requires explaination and challenge to make use of the exploit yourself.

Have fun.
